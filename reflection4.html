                                        <h2>Last week, as I was reflecting on how I was feeling about my HTML learning process <br>
                                            thus far (and as I was coming to the realization that, <em>hey I actually kind of enjoy this</em>), <br>
                                            I kept coming back to the same question: why did it take me so long to get started? </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Why did I dilly-dally, make excuses, stick my head in the sand, and do basically anything to avoid starting?</p>
                            
                                    <p>I didn’t write too much about this in the beginning, but it took me literal WEEKS to start my T550 project. I had an idea, I knew what I needed to do, I had a tentative project timeline…but I just couldn’t start. My project filled me with dread. It felt simultaneously too big <em>and</em> not big enough. I was paralyzed by indecision, even though I knew what I needed to do. I felt Masterpiece Syndrome like nobody’s business – but I kept beating myself up and telling myself, “if you don’t get started soon, this will be the complete <em>opposite</em> of a masterpiece.” My inner critic was out in full force. And she wasn’t being particularly kind to me.</p>
                                                                        
                                    <p>I wish I could say that I had some major breakthrough moment, a moment where the clouds parted and the rain dissipated and the fog in my brain disappeared completely and the path forward was illuminated with radiant luminosity. I wish I could say that I fought valiantly against my inner critic, shut her down, and vanquished her from the kingdom of my mind. None of this was true. In reality, my moment of starting was much less glamorous: I had a deadline, knew that I needed to turn something in the next day, and decided to sign up for a Codecademy account and <em>just start</em>. That was it. There was no fanfare, no jubilee. It was pretty anti-climactic, but for me, it represented a HUGE milestone. </p>
                        
                                    <p>I wish I had more sage wisdom to give myself on why it took me so long to get started. More than anything, I wish this process had taught me some deeply meaningful lesson on why I shouldn’t procrastinate, why I should just do the thing that scares me, or why I should just leap into starting a new project. But I know myself too well: this is <em>far</em> from the last time that I’ll delay getting started on something new. Maybe the lesson is this: my inner critic is still around. She’s still rough on me (and I have a feeling that she’s going to be around for a long time). But maybe, instead of beating myself up for not being where I’d like to be, this is a reminder to be gentle with myself. To neutrally observe what I’m feeling instead of rushing to judge it. To invite my inner critic into a conversation, instead of trying to do everything in my power to shut her down. Maybe the lesson is that the next time I procrastinate or don’t want to get started on something, I can be that much more kind to myself. Or maybe I’ll continue to struggle with self-kindness. </p>
                                                                        
                                    <p>Maybe there is no lesson. Maybe the lesson is that I’m deeply human.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Who knows. For the time being, though, I’m making progress. I’ve started.</p>
