										<h2>Oh, it’s just the sound of the coding gods, laughing at me once I realized one thing <br> that I NEVER anticipated saying: I’m actually enjoying learning HTML.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>It’s the wildest thing. Once I got several lessons in, I realized: hey, this is actually kind of fun. I’m actually enjoying myself. I genuinely feel like I’m learning a new language, but a different kind of language: one that’s written (not spoken), one that’s based on lots of different rules and structures, and one that helps me better communicate with a computer (with a web browser, more specifically). I’ve always enjoyed learning language (spoken ones, that is), and once I started thinking of coding as basically just an extension of language learning, it started to feel easier, and – dare I say – fun.</p>
                            
                                    <p>Like, I look forward to my daily Codecademy lessons. I’m taking notes on E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G, because I can’t help myself and because this is how I learn best. I’ve also color-coded my notes (hi, I’m a Virgo, have we met?), and I’m starting to run out of different colors for each tag – but I just love seeing coding come alive on my paper (and on screen) in such a colorful, bright way.</p>
                        
                                    <p>Here’s what HTML has taught me so far:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Everything that’s opened needs to be closed.</strong> If you start a new sentence, you need to end it with a period (or exclamation point, as I often do). The closing tag is basically just like a period at the end of the end of a sentence. If write a sentence without some sort of closing punctuation, it’s technically incorrect; if you don’t code a closing tag, your code won’t run. </li>
                                        <li><strong>HTML is a lot like German.</strong> Have you ever learned German? Then you know it has ALL OF THE RULES. So many rules; so much structure. I felt totally overwhelmed when I was first learning German – but then I realized that, once you got down the basic rules, it all made sense. German is a beautifully logical language, and HTML follows a similar pattern. Learn the basic rules (plus the occasional exception), and you’ll go a long way.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Coding is just like playing with LEGOS.</strong> Once I started color-coding my notes, I realized that Mitch Resnick was onto something: coding is just like playing with LEGOS. If you imagine each tag as a different color block, you see how perfectly and easily they snap together. On its own, it’s just a LEGO piece, but multiple other little LEGO pieces snapped together form a majestic castle.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Part of me regrets taking so long to get started, because now I just want to CODE ALL THE THINGS. And because I know I’m rapidly running out of time. But I’m not too worried; I’m just thrilled that I could even get to this place to begin with.</p>
