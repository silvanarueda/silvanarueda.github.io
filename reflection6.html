										<h2>In the war of Silvana Rueda v. CSS, Cascading Style Sheets has won a major battle.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I didn’t initially set out to learn CSS. I honestly didn’t even know <em>what</em> CSS was until I started learning HTML (I honestly thought HTML was a hybrid of both languages). But that misconception was shattered pretty quickly after starting my Codecademy lessons.</p>
                            
                                    <p>Enter HTML5, the open-source template that I’ve been using to edit this little blog. It came with a built-in, ready-to-go beautiful CSS template waiting for me to use. Without this CSS template, I would have a blank white website with Times New Roman font (a dull but albeit <em>hella</em> organized website). The moment I downloaded this template, I peeked at the CSS and thought: “I’ve got this! Easy! No need to learn this new language. Let me just tinker with it and change around what I don’t like.”</p>
                                                            
                                    <p><em>I have, once again, made the coding gods burst out laughing.</em></p>
                        
                                    <p>“No need to learn this new language” -- ?!?!?! What was I thinking? I spent H-O-U-R-S fiddling with CSS code, trying to change the colors on this template that I just "didn’t like.” I found a cool AI color palette generating site called <a href="https://colormind.io" target="_blank">Colormind.io</a> which I spent way too much time on (no one needs to know exactly how much), trying to find the <em>perfect</em> color palette for my website. And then I tried to change the CSS code, knowing approximately zero CSS.</p>
                                                                        
                                    <p>You can see where this is going. I messed up the code SO BADLY. Like, at one point, I clicked on one of my blog posts and realized that I had changed the text to white – on a white background. And I couldn't change it back. I finally had to re-download the original open-source template, find the CSS code, copy it into my HTML file, and start over. There may have been tears.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I was so frustrated that I couldn’t get the code to do what I wanted – but I didn’t even consider that I didn’t even <em>know</em> the code.There was always going to be a learning curve involved in tinkering around with a new coding language, like CSS. And I was doing just that -- <em>tinkering.</em> It's like Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich remind us in <em>The Art of Tinkering:</em></p>
                                        
                                        <h5> "When you tinker, you're going to mess up. [...] Failure tells you what you don't know, frustration is making sense of that failure in the moment, and taking action leads to a new way of knowing. Treat each of the problems that arise as a problem to play with -- rather than a problem to solve -- and practice working through times of frustration without judging yourself."</h5>
                                    
                                    <p>Admittedly, I wasn't doing a great job at the "without judging yourself" part. Or the "making sense of that failure in the moment" part. Or the "treat each of the problems that arise as a problem to play with -- rather than a problem to solve" part. I was just massively, overwhelmingly frustrated.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Here's what I've learned so far about the beauty of tinkering: you need to get REALLY comfortable getting stuck when you tinker. It's hard to have an entity theory mindset when tinkering, because it naturally involves failing. <strong>There is no tinkering without failing.</strong> So while I may have a ways to go in my CSS journey (and while I may still get incredibly frustrated when tinkering with the code doesn't produce my intended results), I'll continue to encourage myself to keep Wilkinson & Petrich's Tinkering Tenets in mind. Because even when I feel frustrated beyond belief, even when I sit in my partner's office crying out of exasperation when the damn code isn't doing what I need it to do, even when I feel like I'm stuck in a hole without a visible path to climb myself out, I'm still moving. I'm still growing. In fact, it's in those very moments that I'm moving and growing the most.</p>
