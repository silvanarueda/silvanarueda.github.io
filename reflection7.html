										<h2>It’s no secret that it took me a long time to start the coding process – even when it <br> was the bulk of my T550 project.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This was due in part to many factors <em>(see: On getting started)</em>. But realizing that I just couldn’t see myself as a coder, was chief among that list.</p>

                                    <p>And I know that I’m not the only one. As a brown, immigrant woman of color, I’ve gotten <em>really good</em> at being able to discern which spaces are welcoming to me and which spaces aren’t. It’s not the big, conspicuous factors that signal to me whether or not I belong – it’s the little, convert details that tell me whether or not I’m welcome in any given space or environment. In every room I walk into, I take stock of just how many people of color (especially women of color) are in that room.  That signals to me what kind of battle lies ahead, and who my allies are. In every classroom, I take note of who’s doing the talking and how expertise is being defined. And if no one in that classroom or space looks like me – or if the “experts” in that space don’t look anything like me – well, that tells me something too. </p>

                                    <p>This is how the coding & programming world has felt to me. Despite the efforts of groups like Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code, and others, coding just feels <em>overwhelmingly</em> male and white to me. I had to find my own entry point into this world, and it took me a long time to do so.</p>

                                    <p>What was that entry point, exactly? It was language. I’m an avid language learner. Honestly, if someone just paid me to learn languages for the rest of my life, I would. I learned English at the age of four, after coming to the U.S. with my mom, started learning German at the age of 12, and then started learning French at the age of 19. I also dabbled with (and taken classes in) a number of other languages, including Arabic, Italian, and Wolof, one of the most widely-spoken indigenous languages in Senegal.</p>

                                    <p>When I realized that learning coding was essentially just another language – albeit one that’s written, not spoken – something clicked in me. <em>Dude, this is like an easier version of German,</em> I thought to myself at one point. It gradually became easier to see myself as a coder, since I already see myself as a language learner and German-speaker. This was my “aha” moment that propelled me to not just keep going with my Codecademy lessons, but it’s also when I really started to <em>enjoy</em> my coding lessons. Language was my entry point into coding.</p>

                                    <p>So, my question is: what are the entry points that we can use to help girls and women of color see themselves as computational creators? Language worked for me because I’m a 33-year-old linguistics nerd who would gleefully learn any and every language for the rest of her life. That <em>certainly</em> would not have been my entry point into coding when I was in high school. So, what would’ve been? What would’ve been my entry point into coding when I was sixteen? Or twenty-two? And what are the other entry points that we can use to help girls of color realize that, <em>hey, I can see myself in this field</em>?</p>

                                    <p>Could we use hip hop as an avenue to get girls of color to see themselves as computational creators? There are HELLA parallels between hip hop and coding – could this be an entry point? What about cooking? Or dance? Or…something else entirely? </p>

                                    <p>Once I made this realization, it felt like the possibilities were endless. There are SO many different culturally-relevant entry points that we can use to help girls & women of color to embrace computational thinking and see themselves as computational creators. And we’re going to need ALL of them if we want to move the needle on this issue.</p>
