										<h2>Yes, this is a total humblebrag moment.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Honestly, though, I feel the need to humblebrag about ALL of my coding journey. Like, did I even know three months ago that I would be doing all of this coding? No. Did I even know three <em>weeks</em> ago that I would be able to create a website like this? Also no. So, given the total lack of self-confidence that I started my coding journey on, I feel entitled to a little HUMBLEBRAG to show how far I’ve come.</p>
                            
                                    <p>Anyway, CHECK THIS OUT: I can embed music into my website! I know, SO COOL, right?* Without further ado, here’s the Spotify playlist that’s been keeping me focused as I’ve been embarking on this coding journey:</p>
                        
                                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8NTLI2TtZa6" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>   
                                    
                                    <p>Now, I’m not really one to listen to calm, classical music while studying. I’ve been known to play Biggie first thing in the morning while getting ready for work (much to my introvert partner’s delight). But for whatever reason, this classical music (and the “Intense Study” playlist on Spotify – which is a bunch of soothing piano music) has been my go-to study playlist for the last few weeks.</p>
                        
                                    <p>But occasionally, I need something to dance around to during my study breaks. Enter: Lizzo. Lizzo’s songs (and the dancing-in-my-bedroom that they inspire) have kept my endorphins high for years. And grad school is no different. Here’s the song that I’ve consistently taken work breaks to, since it came out in 2017:</p>

                                    <p>Okay, humblebrag moment over (for now). Back to coding while listening to my music.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>*<em>Shhhh…it’s actually not that hard.</em></p>
