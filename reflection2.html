									<p><strong>Thoughts & questions I had before I started Codecademy:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Is it too late to change my project?</li>
                                        <li>What’s that? It’s time to work on my project, you say? Nope, time to clean/eat a snack/do other work/literally do anything else.</li>
                                        <li>I will do ANYTHING to not start this right now.</li>
                                        <li>I’ll start next week!</li>
                                    </ul>
                    				<p><strong>Thoughts & questions I have as I convince myself to FINALLY get started:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I’m tired of talking about how much I don’t want to start. LET ME JUST GET STARTED.</li>
                                        <li>Wow, the sign-up process was really easy.</li>
                                        <li>I just gave my credit card information to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacdemy</a>. They’re about to charge me $40 in SEVEN DAYS – so I better test them out. I better find out if they’re the learning platform that I want to go with.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Thoughts & questions I have as I go through my first lesson:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>They make it really easy to start. There’s no inner emotional Shakespearean monologue like the one I cycle through in my head every time I even think about starting this project.</li>
                                        <li>OMG THERE’S CODE ON THE FIRST PAGE. What’s that all about. What do I do.</li>
                                       <ul style="padding-left:60px">
                                            <li><em>But also: I need to seriously chill myself out. Let me give this platform a shot, and if it’s not working for me, let me move onto something else. You’ve spent weeks psyching yourself out about even starting your project – just take the first step, see how that feels, and then move onto the next step.</em></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <li>I STARTED! I did the first thing. I have no idea how many more lessons I have left to go, but it feels like it’ll pale in comparison to how long it took me to get started.</li>
                                        <li>What’s the difference between HTML and CSS?</li>
                                        <ul style="padding-left:60px">
                                            <li><em>After Googling the difference:</em> HOLD UP: do I have to learn CSS too?!</li>
                                        </ul>
