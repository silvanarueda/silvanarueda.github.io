									<p> If I can take a moment to pat myself on the back (humblebrag moment part II), I honestly can’t believe how much I’ve done and how far I’ve come since starting this project. It wasn’t that long ago that I was panicking over not having a fleshed-out T550 project proposal. It wasn’t that long ago that I chose my T550 project topic, but then wavered back and forth for <em>forever,</em> trying to decide if coding was really what I was going to do. And it certainly wasn’t that long ago that I finally decided to commit to this project and start. </p>

                                    <p> I presented my project as part of T550 Madness this past Monday (November 30, 2020), and I was honestly surprised at how supportive and excited everyone was about my project. <em>Y’all are excited about my learning to code? Really?</em>  What’s surprising to me isn’t the excitement of others (because we’ve built a really loving, caring community within T550). What surprises me is that I was doubting and second-guessing myself until the MOMENT I presented my T550 project on Monday. I was surprised at everyone’s support, because it felt <em>impossible</em> for me to give <em>myself</em> that same support. It was hard not to beat myself down and make myself feel like I hadn’t done enough, produced enough, or learned enough.</p>

                                    <p>But this project was never about producing something beautiful. It was about allowing myself permission to choose learning and reflection over production. It was about learning a new skill, using that skill to build something that I <em>never</em> thought I could build, and seeing myself in a world that I just assumed wasn’t in the cards for me.</p>

                                    <p>I set out on this journey with the goal of asking: how can we get more girls & women of color to see themselves as computational creators? Before I even started to answer that, I had to ask: how can I see MYSELF – as a woman of color – as a computational creator? At the beginning of this project, I honestly took for granted how difficult it would be to answer that question. Or how personal and emotional it would be. I don’t know if I can fully say that I see myself as “someone who codes” just yet – but I’m starting to see myself as a computational creator more and more each day. I’m slowly building my computational confidence.</p>

                                    <p>This project has taught me so much more than HTML. If I really want to see more girls of color as computational creators, then I have to be prepared to model what that looks like – including wrestling with all of the frustrations, insecurities, anxieties, and contradictions that arise throughout the process. Because, at the end of the day, I can’t open a door for others that I’m not committed to walking through myself.</p>
